  workSummary: I started by trying to understand desired outcome and all the associated
    constraints. I then implemented 3x3 matrix rotation and quaternion rotation based
    on the input angles. I then performed vertex transformations for both ratation
    methods. My major challenges involved using the custom rotation methods required
    for this assigments, instead of unity's built in methods. I also had issues with
    correctly determining the player direction and had to switch the code for my
    directional color effect to get the correct colors in front and behind of the
    player. Overall, this was a challenging but satisfying assignment to complete.
